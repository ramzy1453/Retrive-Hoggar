# Retrive Hoggar 

A videogame made with Unity3D
In the heart of the Saharan desert lies the ancient village of Hoggar, a place where time seems to stand still amidst the shifting sands. But tranquility is shattered when the French colonial forces set their eyes on this remote settlement, seeing it as a strategic foothold in their expansion across North Africa.

As the French troops descend upon Hoggar with their advanced weaponry and overwhelming numbers, the villagers find themselves facing a dire threat to their way of life. Determined to defend their homes and preserve their autonomy, the people of Hoggar rally together to resist the foreign invaders.

You, as the player, step into the shoes of a young villager who witnesses the chaos and destruction wrought by the French soldiers. Your mission: to lead the resistance and drive the occupiers out of Hoggar.
